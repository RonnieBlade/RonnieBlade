### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with experience in full stack development, creating websites, chatbots, parsing and test automation, prototyping, API and desktop development. Also working in music, video production and VFX.

Growing up in a creative family of technical scientists and musicians, I have been fascinated with information technologies and art since childhood. I took part in a programming competition and reached the National Olympiad in Informatics at the age of 8. When I was 12, I developed my first game that had a certain amount of popularity untill Flash was discontinued in December 2020:) Software development has always been an art of beauty and harmony to me. That is the reason why I manage to combine IT and music together.

Working as an artist and producer in show business, I gained invaluable experience in management and marketing during participation in big international projects and collaborating with major advertising companies as well as implementing my own ideas. Moreover, my experience in software engineering encourages me to bring marketing concepts to life on my own or under my guidance.

Always ready to to challenge myselfâš¡
